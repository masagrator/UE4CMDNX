# UE4CMDNX

Set of SaltyNX plugins + homebrew to use commands in Unreal Engine 4 games for Nintendo Switch.

Each plugin must be crafted for each game specifically because of how there are differences in getting game's instance. Finding function responsible for accepting commands is pretty universal from various researches.

Plugins store main.cpp that should use to replace the same file in ReverseNX-RT plugin source code and compile.
